# Copilot Instructions for AI Coding Agents

## Project Overview
This codebase is a Python learning workspace, currently focused on foundational concepts. The main directory is `S01_Variables`, containing `variables.py`, which demonstrates Python variable usage and basic syntax.

## Architecture & Structure
- Each major topic or lesson is organized into its own folder (e.g., `S01_Variables`).
- Files within each folder are named to reflect their content (e.g., `variables.py` for variable-related examples).
- Expect future folders for other Python topics (e.g., functions, control flow, data structures).

## Developer Workflows
- **No build system or test framework is present.**
- Run scripts directly using Python:
  ```bash
  python S01_Variables/variables.py
  ```
- No external dependencies are required for current files.

## Conventions & Patterns
- Code is written for clarity and educational value, not production robustness.
- Each script is self-contained and does not import from other project files.
- Use descriptive variable names and inline comments to explain concepts.
- Avoid advanced Python features unless the lesson requires them.

## Integration Points
- No external APIs, databases, or services are integrated at this stage.
- Future lessons may introduce standard libraries or third-party packages; update this file as needed.

## Example Pattern
```python
# S01_Variables/variables.py
x = 5  # integer variable
name = "Alice"  # string variable
# ...more examples and explanations...
```

## Guidance for AI Agents
- When adding new lessons, create a new folder (e.g., `S02_Functions`) and place topic-specific scripts inside.
- Keep code simple and focused on the topic.
- Update this file to document new conventions or workflows as the project evolves.
